    <h2>Kitties come to Kenosha</h2>
    <p>Kenosha recently opened its first Cat Cafe, a fab new trend that is present in major cities and other countries such as Japan. The cafe,     named <em>Pawlicous Pastries</em>, recently opened downtown near the lakefront. It offers lots of tasty treats like cookies, muffins, coffee,    as well as the company of a bunch of cute felines.</p>
    <p2>What makes it better, is that all the adorable kitties are adoptable! Each and every one of them is a rescue that comes from the nearby     Humane Society. They are all also spayed/neutered and litter box trained, as well as being conditioned to be family pets. All of them are        cuddly as can be!</p2>
    <h3>Why a Cat Cafe?</h3>
    <p3>A lot of people are asking, why does Kenosha need a cat cafe? Well, the owners says that, <q>We want people to adopt, not shop, and         having a cat cafe can induce adoptions without the hassle of going to shelters. Plus, who doesn't love eating cookies and petting cats?</q> So     far, it has worked, as many of the cafe's cats have been adopted by singles and families alike. The cafe's cats are a range of ages and          breeds, meaning that there's a kitty for everyone.</p3>
